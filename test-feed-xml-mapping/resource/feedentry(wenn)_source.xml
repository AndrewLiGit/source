             <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DEMI LOVATO is sporting a sling after injuring her arm in a fall shortly before she was due on stage in Texas.</p>
<p>The pop star shared a picture of her arm in a protective sling on Twitter.com before her gig in San Antonio on Friday (19Sep14), writing, &quot;Welp. Looks like I won&#039;t be playing guitar, piano OR drums tonight. San Antonio... Why did you have to go and make me fall so hard for you?!! (sic)&quot;</p>
<p>The snap sparked fears Lovato had suffered a nasty break which would take months to heal, but a representative for the star has now confirmed the injury is not that serious, telling Gossipcop.com, &quot;She fell and hurt her arm, but it&#039;s not broken.&quot;</p>
