We are immensely proud to be returning it to the schedule with a thrilling new twist that will bring it up to date and introduce a whole new set of rooting opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>	&nbsp;&ldquo;The competition is going to be much more exciting for viewers and even more demanding for the dancers,&rdquo; said co-creator and executive producer Nigel Lythgoe. &ldquo;Dancers from different genres have always been competitive with each other and we&rsquo;ve found a great way to harness that to bring out the absolute best performances in the best dancers across the country.&rdquo;</p>
